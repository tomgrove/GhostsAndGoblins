Incomplete assembly and reverse engineering of Keith Burkhill's  1986 spectrum title

Ghosts 'n Goblins was notable at the time for its impressive scrolling. Unlike the arcade machines of the mid to late eighties, the zx-spectrum had no hardware support for sprites or smooth scrolling. This made it very challenging to port popular arcade games to the platform. Ghosts 'n Goblins was one such title - a notoriously difficult eight way scrolling run-and-gun game published by Capcom.

Initial analysis in IDA, then converted to skool-kit ( http://skoolkit.ca/ ) for publishing. Not especially readable yet.
